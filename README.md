# functools:
The functools module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be treated as a function for the purposes of this module. It provides functions for working with other functions and callable objects to use or extend them without completely rewriting them. This module has two classes – partial and partialmethod.
